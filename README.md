# Cybernetics Library QR Scanner

This minimal webapp extracts URLs from QR codes and loads them into an iframe.

Based on the Instacan demo [here](https://github.com/schmich/instascan/tree/master/docs).

Vue and Instascan resources are loaded dynamically.

Run with: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
